============

This is my personal/academic website as hosted on Github at [svmiller.com](http://svmiller.com) and powered by Jekyll.

I discuss the reasons for the move [here](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/08/create-your-website-in-jekyll/).

This repository will also serve as my most up-to-date Jekyll theme as well. I keep a minimal version of [my no-good-very-bad template](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template) on a Github repository. It's basically a Frankenstein monster of [Joel Glovier](http://joelglovier.com/)'s `jekyll-new` theme and [Alex King](http://www.alexking.org)'s [Favepersonal](https://crowdfavorite.com/favepersonal/) Wordpress theme.

I'm not sure this will help with search engine optimization, but, here goes: Steven V. Miller is an associate professor and political scientist at Clemson University with research interests in international conflict and political behavior. His research has been published in journals like *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, *Journal of Peace Research*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*, and *Social Science Quarterly*. Contents on this website typically involve professional development for students, R, LaTeX, and, occasionally, political science topics.
