Our new paper (with [Klaus Keller](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/)) has been published in [Environmental Modeling & Software](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.104978).

Using a perfect model experiment, we demonstrate how small increases in agent-based model complexity can result in large differences in the data required to calibrate the model, as well as identifying the correct (in this case, the data-generating) model structure. This result emphasizes the importance of treating model structural uncertainty as a deep uncertainty, rather than committing to a particular parameterization. It also demonstrates the importance of leveraging multiple independent sources of information to construct sound and informative prior distributions.

The paper is open-access, and there is [a preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08524) available as well.
