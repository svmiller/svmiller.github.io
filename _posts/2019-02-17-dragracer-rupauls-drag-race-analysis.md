My wife got me hooked into watching RuPaul's Drag Race with her. The long and short of it is I didn't need to have my arm twisted to watch or enjoy the show. Indeed, drag nights at Icon in Tuscaloosa---incidentally home to [the performer who gave Trinity her "Tuck" moniker](https://twitter.com/leland2genesis?lang=en)---are some of my fondest memories of graduate school. A performer who routinely served as opening act for her---[and sadly passed away](http://obits.al.com/obituaries/birmingham/obituary.aspx?n=kevin-thomas&pid=188344432&fhid=6039) last year---was among the sweetest/kindest person I knew in town.[^herdoc] I had a receptiveness to drag as concept and creative outlet, but oddly did not know about the show until my wife told me about it.

[^herdoc]: The University of Alabama's Center for Ethics and Social Responsibility [produced a video about her experience](http://documentingjustice.org/bambi-was-a-boy/) that's worth watching.
