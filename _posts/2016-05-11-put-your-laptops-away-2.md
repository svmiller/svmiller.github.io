[Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014)](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/6/1159) published the best articulated argument against the use of laptops during class. [Carter et al. (2016)](https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.02-Payne-Carter-Greenberg-and-Walker-2.pdf) having a working paper that reiterates the same point.

> We present findings from a study that prohibited computer devices in randomly selected 
classrooms of an introductory economics course at the United States Military Academy. Average 
final exam scores among students assigned to classrooms that allowed computers were 18 
percent of a standard deviation lower than exam scores of students in classrooms that prohibited 
computers. Through the use of two separate treatment arms, we uncover evidence that this 
negative effect occurs in classrooms where laptops and tablets are permitted without restriction 
and in classrooms where students are only permitted to use tablets that must remain flat on the desk surface.
