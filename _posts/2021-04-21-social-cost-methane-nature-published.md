We have a paper (with [Frank Errickson](https://cpree.princeton.edu/people/frank-errickson){:target="_blank"}, [Klaus Keller](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~kzk10/){:target="_blank"}, [William Collins](https://eesa.lbl.gov/profiles/william-collins/){:target="_blank"}, and [David Anthoff](https://www.david-anthoff.com/){:target="_blank"} published today in [Nature](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03386-6){:target="_blank"} on the social cost of methane (SC-CH<sub>4</sub>). The social cost of a greenhouse gas quantifies the net present value of emitting a unit amount of the gas (in this case, methane) into the atmosphere. This cost enables cost-benefit analyses of regulations proposing changes to limits on their emissions, which are a required part of the regulatory process.

We show how several factors influence estimates of the SC-CH<sub>4</sub>, including how:

* accounting for climate-system uncertainty results in a decreased estimate compared to that used by the US government, partially due to nonlinear relationships between uncertainties related to temperature dynamics;
* the sensitivity of SC-CH<sub>4</sub> to scenarios of future warming is of a comparable magnitude to that resulting from different discount rates;
* the SC-CH<sub>4</sub> estimates vary little when different climate models are used, but show large sensitivities to the choice of integrated assessment model; and
* the use of equity-weighting instead of constant discount rates results in large increases in the SC-CH<sub>4</sub> for wealthier regions such as the US compared to regions which consume less, justifying higher mitigation expenditures in high-income countries, and these increases dwarf the decreases from climate uncertainties.

The paper is not open access, but the News and Views perspective is available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00972-6){:target="_blank"}.
