<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and the classes that I teach. I am an associate professor in the <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/cbbs/departments/political-science/">Department of Political Science</a> at <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a> and a <a href="https://www.bitss.org/people/steven-miller/">BITSS Catalyst</a> with the <a href="https://www.bitss.org">Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences</a>.</p>

	<p>I use statistics and machine learning to understand why people adopt authoritarian political beliefs or embrace autocratic leaders in response to real or perceived threats. This puts my research and teaching interests at the broad intersection of international conflict and political behavior. I have published in peer-reviewed journals like <em>Comparative Political Studies</em>, <em>International Studies Quarterly</em>, <em>Journal of Conflict Resolution</em>, <em>Journal of Peace Research</em>, <em>Political Behavior</em>, and <em>Political Research Quarterly</em>, to name a few. More recent research is funded by the National Science Foundation and has even been highlighted in newspapers like <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The Washington Post</em>.</p>
