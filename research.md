My research focuses on international conflict, particularly over the distribution of territory. I examine the effect these territorial issues have on domestic politics, particularly at the level of the individual citizen. Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and research in progress. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in reading unpublished manuscripts on which I am currently working. I welcome feedback.
