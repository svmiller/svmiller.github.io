My research focuses on two broad sets of question. The first and most active part of my research agenda explores the effect of external threat, especially to the territorial integrity of the state, on the political attitudes of citizens. Here, I have a keen interest in what happens to citizen attitudes toward the government and what type of authority the government should have. The second part of my research agenda is rooted in the peace science approach to the study of international conflict. Here, my research has explored either the conditions of conflict onset and escalation or how we should properly code these events. In addition, I have also published various items on political topics of interest to me in light of current events and have also published software to assist in the research and learning experience of others. I offer [a three-page research statement](/docs/svm-research-statement.pdf) that summarizes and contextualizes all my research. [My CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/) contains some more information about works in progress and where some of these works in progress are in the peer review process. [A statement of societal interaction](/docs/svm-societal-interaction.pdf) elaborates how my research has had an impact on society in the form of various media appearances and discussions with journalists about my research.

<!-- I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects. [My CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/) contains more information about where some of these projects are in the peer review process.

I also offer [a three-page research statement](/docs/svm-research-statement.pdf) that summarizes and contextualizes my different research agendas. -->
