When you think about "climate change" and "the electric power system," the first thing that might come to mind is the need to decarbonize electricity generation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But future changes to environmental risks such as heat waves and flooding can reduce grid reliability while increasing demand. And California has seen blackouts resulting from attempts to manage wildfire risks by power utilities. We investigate the impact of these mechanisms under deep climate uncertainty for today's decisions about energy system infrastructure investments.
