# What Do We Know About British Attitudes Toward Immigration?
## Introduction
### Goals for Today

1. Learn about immigration sentiment in the UK.
2. Teach students how to evaluate a regression table.
3. Tell you a bit more about myself.

### Check My Blog at svmiller.com/blog

### A Regression Roadmap

Regression as we use it is a combination of hypothesis-testing and story-telling.

1. Know the bigger picture/puzzle.
2. Know the data.
3. Understand what the regression table is (and *isn't*) saying.
<!-- 3. Understand what the regression table *isn't* saying. -->

## Know the Bigger Picture/Puzzle
### Know the Bigger Picture/Puzzle

How positively do British people regard immigration/immigrants?

\begin{center}Why is this important? How can we know?\end{center}

<!-- ## Know the Data -->
<!-- ### Know the Data -->

<!-- Scan the research design section for the following information: -->

<!-- 1. The (primary) source of the data -->
<!-- 2. The **unit of analysis** (i.e. who/what is being studied) -->
<!-- 3. The **dependent variable** (i.e. the variable to be explained) -->
<!-- 4. The **independent variable(s)** (i.e. what we be believe explains the dependent variable) -->

### Know the Data

1. The **data:** European Social Survey (2018) for the UK
2. The **unit of analysis:** the individual respondent in the survey
    - Note: I subset the analysis to just those who were born in the UK.

### Know the Data

The **dependent variable** (*DV*) is an additive index [0:30] of three prompts:

- Is it generally bad or good for the UK’s economy that immigrants come to live here? 
    - (`imbgeco`) [0:10; bad:good]
- Is the UK’s cultural life is generally undermined or enriched by immigrants? 
    - (`imueclt`) [0:10; undermined:enriched]
- Is the UK made a worse or a better place to live by immigrants?
    - (`imwbcnt`) [0:10; worse:better]

Higher values = more pro-immigration sentiment.

ESS9GB %>%
  group_by(immigsent) %>% # group_by unique values of immigsent
  summarize(n = n()) %>% # return number of times that particular value was coded for variable
  na.omit %>% # drop NAs, which won't matter much here.

       title = "A Bar Chart of Pro-Immigration Sentiment in the United Kingdom from the ESS Data (Round 9)",
       subtitle = "There's a natural heaping of 0s and 30s but the mean (16.891) approximates the median (17). I'd feel comfortable communicating exact differences on this scale.")
```

### Know the Data

The **independent variables** (*IVs*):

- *Age* (in years)
- *Education* (in years of education)
- *Gender* (1 if respondent is a woman)
- *Employment status* (1 if respondent is unemployed, but looking for work)
- *Household income* (in deciles)
- *Ideology* (on 11-point L-R scale)



## Understand What the Regression is Saying
###  Understand What the Regression is Saying

**(Linear/OLS) Regression** is a tool for understanding a phenomenon of interest (immigration sentiment) as a linear function of some combination of predictors.

- Strong resemblance to the slope-intercept equation (`y = mx + b`)
- Flexible to include multiple predictors (i.e. **multiple regression**)

### Unpacking the Regression Table

Here are the three things you probably noticed from this table: 

1. The numbers inside parentheses next to a variable.
2. The numbers *not* in parentheses next to a variable.
3. Some of those numbers not in parentheses have some asterisks next to them.

Let's start with the second item.

### The Regression Coefficient

The number *not* inside a parentheses is a **regression coefficient**.

- These communicate the *estimated* change in the *DV* for a one-unit change in a particular *IV*.
<!-- - They are the betas ($\beta$) in the formula. -->
<!-- - The "Constant" is the *y*-intercept ($\beta_0$). -->

Use the coefficients to assess **negative** and **positive relationships**.

- **Positive:** as an *IV* increases, the *DV* also increases (and vice-versa).
- **Negative:** as an *IV* decreases, the *DV* increases (and vice-versa).

                          "hinctnta" = "Household Income (Deciles)",
                          "lrscale" = "Ideology (L to R)",

  row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, italic = FALSE, color='#000000')
```

### The Standard Error

The number inside parentheses is the **standard error** of the regression coefficient.

- i.e. it's a measure of uncertainty around the estimate.

However, this is not an important quality by itself.

- It depends on its relationship with the regression coefficient.

<!-- This leads to the third item of interest. -->

### The Asterisks

The asterisks are an indicator of **statistical significance**.

- Divide the regression coefficient over its standard error to get a **t-statistic**.
<!-- - This gives you a **t-statistic**. -->
- If the absolute value of the **t-statistic** is at least "about 2", you can feel confident rejecting a claim of zero effect.

**tl;dr**: what is the probability of us observing this coefficient and standard error if the true effect is zero?

- The asterisks are your visual cue to identify a "statistically significant" effect.

<!-- In our case, only education, income, and ideology have statistically significant effects. -->

## Understand What the Regression Table *Isn't* Saying
### Understand What the Regression Table *Isn't* Saying

1. The "constant" (or *y*-intercept) is not a "variable."
    - It's just an estimate of *y* when everything else is zero.
2. The regression table doesn't test the regression model's multiple assumptions.
    - Look at your data and your model.
3. "Statistically significant is not itself 'significant.'"
    - "Significance" says nothing about the magnitude of the effect, only if you can discern it from zero.
    
<!-- 4. More asterisks do not mean "more significance." -->
<!-- - It won't tell you if one effect is greater than another, only that it's more precise. -->
    
## Conclusion
### Conclusion

Regression is both hypothesis-testing and story-telling. Some takeaways:

1. Make sure you're reading about the bigger picture/puzzle.
2. Take stock of the data.
3. Evaluate a regression table you read by the direction of the relationship (+ or -) and what effects are "significant."
4. Internalize what the regression table *isn't* telling you.

Table: Descriptive Statistics for the Variables in Our Regression

###  Understand What the Regression is Saying

We believe we can explain the *DV* for an individual ($i$) as:

\begin{eqnarray}
\textrm{Immigration Sentiment}_i &=& \beta_0 + \beta_1*\textrm{Age}_i + \beta_2*\textrm{Female}_i +   \nonumber \\
   &&  \beta_3*\textrm{Years of Education}_i +  \beta_4*\textrm{Unemployed}_i +    \nonumber \\
   &&  \beta_5*\textrm{Household Income}_i + \beta_6*\textrm{Ideology}_i + \epsilon_i \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

Of note:

- $\beta_0$: estimated immigration sentiment when all predictors are set to zero (i.e. *y*-intercept)
- $\beta_{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$: estimated slopes of each *IV* on the *DV*
- $\epsilon$: error term (unmeasured)
