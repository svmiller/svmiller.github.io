This course will introduce students to the politics of United States foreign policy and the process by which foreign policy is produced. The scope in this class will focus on all the actors involved in foreign policy decision-making. We will start with all actors that comprise the executive branch beyond just the president. We will move next to Congress and, later, societal actors like interest groups, the media, and public opinion, more generally. Each discussion of actors will include applications to past or current policy issues to illustrate how these actors influence the decision-making process. By the end of the course, students should appreciate that understanding American foreign policy requires understanding who participates, what are their preferences, and how influential or powerful actors are.
