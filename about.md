I do have interests outside of the academy, but not many.

I am a proud graduate of <a class="tosu" href="http://www.osu.edu/"><em><abbr title="Yes, the THE is important">The</abbr></em> Ohio State University</a>. I do not conceal that well, nor do I try. This is especially true during football season.

I don’t have much time beyond obsessing about the Buckeyes to follow other sports. That said, I’m convinced the Cleveland Browns will be [the first team in the NFL to go 20-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPLzmctAInQ) and, likewise, the [Cleveland Guardians](https://www.mlb.com/indians/fans/cleteamname) will be the first team in Major League Baseball history to finish the season 173-0. I believe these are reasonable, modest predictions for the Browns and Guardians that I make every season. Now, I’ve been wrong about these projections before---repeatedly, in all honesty. However, I’ve got a really good feeling about next year...
