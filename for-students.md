This is the parent page for a list of resources for students of mine at Clemson University or students in the Department of Political Science. Students should also read dedicated pages I have to [Pi Sigma Alpha](/for-students/pi-sigma-alpha/) and obtaining [letters of recommendation](/for-students/letters-of-recommendation/).

## Office Hours

My office is in 230A Brackett Hall. Office hours for fall and spring semester are typically Wednesday, 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Students may visit the following page to [schedule me for an appointment](/for-students/office-hours-appointment/) in my office.

## Clemson’s Academic Calendar and Exam Schedule

These links will be as useful for students as they will be for me. I find myself looking for these every now and then.

## Writing Resources

I never used [my alma mater’s writing center](https://cstw.osu.edu/writing-center) when I was an undergraduate. In hindsight, I wish I did. Clemson’s political science students needs to take better advantage of this resource. Check [The Writing Center at Clemson](http://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/writing/) for resources to help you with your papers and other writing pursuits.

Borrowing from my friend [Andy Owsiak](http://www.andrewowsiak.org/for-students.html)'s (Georgia) resources, I also recommend the following books to help you with writing. The McCloskey (2000) and Thomson (2001) books are my recommendations though the focus of both is in economics.

- Becker, Howard S. 1986. *Writing for Social Scientists: How to Start and Finish your Thesis, Book, or Article*. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.
- McCloskey, Deirdre N. 2000. *Economical Writing* (2nd ed.). Long Grove: Waveland Press, Inc.
- Strunk, William and E.B. White. 2000. *The Elements of Style* (4th ed.). New York: Longman.
- Thomson, William. 2001. *A Guide for the Young Economist*. Cambridge: MIT Press.
- Zinsser, William. 2006. *On Writing Well*. New York: HarperCollins.

## Disability Services and Test Proctoring

Clemson University is a public university compliant with the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act that guarantees the provision of services at the university level to qualified students with disabilities. However, it is the student’s job to initiate the provision of these services through the university. Two resources will be important. One is the [Student Disability Services](http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/campus-services/sds/) (SDS). SDS provides [a directory of forms](http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/campus-services/sds/forms.html) an eligible student may need to file with me.

The other is the [Test Proctoring Center](https://sds.app.clemson.edu/tpc/) (TPC). **Be mindful** of TPC’s regulations. For example, scheduling a final exam in the testing center must be done (basically) two weeks in advance. A student that requires a quiet testing room for a midterm must also take the initiative to schedule the midterm at least a week before the day of the exam.
