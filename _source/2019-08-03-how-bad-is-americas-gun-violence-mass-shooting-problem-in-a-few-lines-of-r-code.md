[Another day, another mass
shooting](https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/03/us/el-paso-shooting/index.html)
for literally the only country of its size and development where this
happens on a routine basis. This one in El Paso may (reportedly) have
some domestic terrorist overtones to it, but barring confirmation of the
shooter and the shooter’s motives for the moment, this post will focus
on just the gun violence and the mass shooting angle here.

Gun control emerged as a political and academic hobby horse of mine
largely because the problem strikes me as a massive and obvious public
health problem that has a fairly simple solution on paper. Cheap gun
supply—especially of weapons like AR-15s and AK-47s that have no
practical use for hobbyists, hunters, ranchers, or those with an earnest
interest in self-defense—decreases the transaction costs associated with
carrying out violent rampages (see:
[Wintemute, 2005](https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/guns-and-gun-violence)
and [Bartley and
Williams, 2018](https://events.iadb.org/events/handler/geteventdocument.ashx?AFCF784DCD0CBF43BE2C6862BF3344018A6A5CB902FA5578FDC3D0A580A830F93EB421FAAECD73D52562D8C42E362FA5853AE10D3E97D4160C156BD8B16088D305C031362E48EDD5)).
The quality of those assault rifles in particular also increase the
costs for first-responders, putting them at risk and delaying much
needed aid. This raises the societal costs for these “transactions”
carried out by perpetrators. Restricting gun supply should raise the
transaction costs associated with executing a violent rampage. Again,
it’s not hard. If you don’t believe that, then you don’t believe
people respond to economic incentives.

Obviously, there’s no political will here. [The public opinion is
there](http://svmiller.com/research/what-americans-really-think-about-gun-control/)
in support of most forms of gun control, even subtly aggressive forms of
gun control, but GOP voters are gradually adopting cues from GOP elites
on this topic. At the elite-level, the GOP relies on the National Rifle
Association—which wants cheap guns for purchase to the benefit of gun
manufacturers—to help [message “conservatism” to the voting
bloc](https://www.amazon.com/Guns-Democracy-Insurrectionist-Joshua-Horwitz/dp/0472033700)
and massage over other issues for GOP partisans (on fiscal policies, for
example). The National Rifle Association is well-funded and partisan
sorting has made them credible threats to primary GOP legislators who
don’t cooperate with them.

Alas, here we are: massive public health problem—*needless* public
health problem—fairly simple and straightforward policy proposals, and
no real (collective) will to do them. 🤷

Anywho, a few lines of R code will emphasize the scope of the problem.

First, [GunPolicy.org](https://www.gunpolicy.org) is an excellent
repository of information about gun deaths, gun laws, and gun
trafficking for a slew of countries over time. It also has fairly
comprehensive coverage of estimated gun homicides per 100,000 people
that leans on country reports from various agencies (e.g. Center for
Disease Control, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, World Health
Organization) and incorporates information from academic research on gun
homicides as well when necessary. Since we’re dealing with advanced
countries, there is high confidence in the estimates even if not all
years are covered (e.g. the latest year for Germany in the data is
2015).

<!-- United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime data (see: [here](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Homicides_by_firearms.xls)) will emphasize how the U.S. stands out among peer countries. I link to the spreadsheet in this post. It's an *ugly* spreadsheet that requires some tidying and eye-balling things in LibreOffice for slicing, but it can be done all the same. Do note: the data are mostly limited to 2009/2010 observations, not that it should meaningfully change the takeaway here. The U.S. will conspicuously be an island among peer countries (i.e. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Western/Northern Europe) for its homicide by firearm rate. -->

I gathered data for 25 peer countries to the U.S. (i.e. Western Europe,
Northern Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) in addition to data
for the U.S. on gun homicides per 100,000 people in the population. I
created a data frame for it (`ghp100k`) and added it to [my `stevemisc`
package.](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc). You can [read more
about the data
here](https://github.com/svmiller/stevemisc/blob/master/man/ghp100k.Rd)
and, better yet, [check the underlying sources
here](https://www.gunpolicy.org).

We can first assess the scope of the problem by selecting on the latest
years for all 25 countres in the data. Here, it’s apparent the U.S. will
conspicuously be an island among peer countries for its gun homicide
rate. The U.S. had a gun homicide rate (per 100,000 people) in 2017 of
an astounding 4.46. The next closest country is Canada, with a rate .75.
The U.S. rate is almost six times the next closest country in gun
homicides.

``` r
# require(tidyverse)
# require(stevemisc)
# data(ghp100k)

ghp100k %>%
  arrange(country, year) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  slice(n()) %>%
  mutate(cy = paste0(country,"\n(", year, ")")) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(reorder(cy, -ghp100k), ghp100k)) +
  theme_steve_web() +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", alpha=0.6, color="black") +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(ghp100k, 2)), vjust=-.5, colour="black",
            position=position_dodge(.9), size=4, family="Open Sans") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)) +
  labs(x = "Country (Year)",
       y = "Homicide by Firearm Rate (per 100,000 population)",
       caption = "Data: gunpolicy.org, through various other sources (e.g. UNODC, CDC, WHO).",
       title = "The United States' Gun Homicide Rate (per 100,000 People) is Almost Six Times The Next Closest Peer Country",
       subtitle = "Other countries are reducing what are already low rates. The U.S. rate is only increasing.")
```

The data I collected have a time-series component as well to assess
changes over time. A few things are worth highlighting here. First, the
U.S. gun homicide rate had been much worse a few decades ago. This we
knew. Crime rates everywhere in the United States were higher a few
decades ago than they are now. Still, the gun homicide rate is
*increasing* in the United States since 2009. By comparison, they’re
improving in every other country, prominently Italy.

Finally, you can start thinking about automating a script to scan [the
Mother Jones database on mass
shootings](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/)
to note how this problem is only getting worse. In subsequent updates, I
might try to fully automate this with built-in assessments of how much
worse the problem is getting.

Because it’s only getting worse.
