              adaptation efforts for improving coastal resiliency? Using
              Norfolk, Virginia, as a case study, we start to address these
              questions by characterizing and quantifying the drivers of
              differences between published sea-level rise and storm surge

              complex behavior of ice sheets are the primary drivers of flood
              hazard diversity. Adopting a single hazard projection neglects
              key uncertainties and can lead to overconfident projections and
              downwards biased hazard estimates. These results highlight key

  abstract = "When researchers complete a manuscript, they need to choose a
              journal to which they will submit the study. This decision
              requires to navigate trade-offs between multiple objectives. One
              objective is to share the new knowledge as widely as possible.
              Citation counts can serve as a proxy to quantify this objective.
              A second objective is to minimize the time commitment put into
              sharing the research, which may be estimated by the total time
              from initial submission to final decision. A third objective is
              to minimize the number of rejections and resubmissions. Thus,
              researchers often consider the trade-offs between the objectives
              of (i) maximizing citations, (ii) minimizing time-to-decision,
              and (iii) minimizing the number of resubmissions. To complicate
              matters further, this is a decision with multiple, potentially
              conflicting, decision-maker rationalities. Co-authors might have
              different preferences, for example about publishing fast versus
              maximizing citations. These diverging preferences can lead to
              conflicting trade-offs between objectives. Here, we apply a
              multi-objective decision analytical framework to identify the
              Pareto-front between these objectives and determine the set of
              journal submission pathways that balance these objectives for
              three stages of a researcher's career. We find multiple
              strategies that researchers might pursue, depending on how they
              value minimizing risk and effort relative to maximizing
              citations. The sequences that maximize expected citations within
              each strategy are generally similar, regardless of time horizon.
              We find that the ``conditional impact factor''-impact factor
              times acceptance rate-is a suitable heuristic method for ranking
              journals, to strike a balance between minimizing effort
              objectives and maximizing citation count. Finally, we examine
              potential co-author tension resulting from differing
              rationalities by mapping out each researcher's preferred Pareto
              front and identifying compromise submission strategies. The
              explicit representation of trade-offs, especially when multiple
              decision-makers (co-authors) have different preferences,
              facilitates negotiations and can support the decision process.",

              risks to coastal communities and infrastructures. Strategies for
              managing these flood risks present decision challenges that
              require a combination of geophysical, economic, and
              infrastructure models. Previous studies have broken important new
              ground on the considerable tensions between the costs of
              upgrading infrastructure and the damages that could result from
              extreme flood events. However, many risk-based adaptation
              strategies remain silent on certain potentially important
              uncertainties, as well as the tradeoffs between competing
              objectives. Here, we implement and improve on a classic
              decision-analytical model (Van Dantzig 1956) to: (i) capture
              tradeoffs across conflicting stakeholder objectives, (ii)
              demonstrate the consequences of structural uncertainties in the
              sea-level rise and storm surge models, and (iii) identify the
              parametric uncertainties that most strongly influence each
              objective using global sensitivity analysis. We find that the
              flood adaptation model produces potentially myopic solutions when
              formulated using traditional mean-centric decision theory. Moving
              from a single-objective problem formulation to one with
              multiobjective tradeoffs dramatically expands the decision space,
              and highlights the need for compromise solutions to address
              stakeholder preferences. We find deep structural uncertainties
              that have large effects on the model outcome, with the storm
              surge parameters accounting for the greatest impacts. Global
              sensitivity analysis effectively identifies important parameter
              interactions that local methods overlook, and that could have
              critical implications for flood adaptation strategies.",
